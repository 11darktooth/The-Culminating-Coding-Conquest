# The Culminating Coding Conquest
The Culminating Coding Conquest git repo is here to hold all the source files for The Conquest!

The main objective of the project is to have Cary Academy stop teaching Java, and opt to teach a better language... at least in our opinion. The languages used are:
 - Java    (the base language)
 - C       (The procedural language)
 - Haskell (The functional language)
 - Python  (The practically everything language)

Code examples will be written in each of the languages, which will show off the alternative solutions to solving each problem. Most examples will be what you'd see in a classroom, or solutions to Project Euler; in addition, there will also be real world problems that someone would see while at a job. This will help show off the languages in both a classroom (teaching) environment, as well as the real world.
